# EasyA Website

This is the source code for [EasyA](https://easya.io/).

The so called "respected" and "reputed" clients didn't pay for us, so I decided to make my work (our team's hard work) public.

We tried several times to contact them but we didn't get a response. I hereby release the code in GPL. Feel free to use it however you want.

Folks, I just set this up so that it might help you to identify and grab something! ðŸ˜¸
